# Environment

1. Tensorflow 2.1
2. Python 3.6

# Training and evaluation

>ğŸ“‹ Python xxx.py, the model will be automatically trained and then report the results after the training.

>ğŸ“‹ Different parameter settings of LMix would lead different results and we also provide different settings used in our experiments.
